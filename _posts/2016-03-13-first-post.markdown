The Journey starts taking a Video games course in my University. As a part of learning good practices as developers, we had to create a DevBlog. So, this it's mine!. I'm going to write about how I'm learning and developing games.

### The Framework

Game developing is hard. There it's a lot of code in the final result. This is where Frameworks plays a role here. The function of them, it's trying to do this hard work, into something more easy to manage.
The games that are going to be developed, are going to be in HTML5 format. The Professor recommended the following Frameworks:

- Phaser
- Cocos2DJS
- Gdevelop
- Unity

Because of having a lot of previous experience using Javascript in some Web Development courses that I take, I choose to use Phaser.
This Framework its Game developing in Javascript. The framework adds objects and functions, to make the game developing experience more natural. For example, has functions to draw sprites, and do things when they interact.

### Getting Started with Phaser

A new semester starts in University. The first day, a assignment of making two games, is given to the course for the next week.
having zero experience in Game Developing, and also trying to adapt to the new University semester, I have the task of getting into this.
Phaser it's chosen as the Framework that it's going to be used.
The first thing that I did, is follow the tutorials. Then, play around with functions, and seeing how the code get's to work.

### The first two games

But the assignment, is develop two prototypes. I'm not so good to choose some ideas, because with too many options, is hard to choose one to make the project.
Weekend has come. I have very little done in the week. But I dedicated Saturday in developing the first game, and Saturday the second, and also give time to create the Blog.

#### Prototype 1: A shooting based Game

The first game of all, it's a simple "shoot the target" type game. In a certain time, the player has to shoot as many targets as posible, to maximize his score.
Here are the steps to had the result:

- Get the player move around the window, in four directions
- The player can shoot bullets also in four directions. So, worked on making bullets appear.
- The targets are created in a random position on the screen. Also, only one target is visible during the game.
- Had a time limit, to get the score.
The Game is very basic. Here are some future improvements that, in case the prototype it's chosen to continue the process, I will work in the features:
- Had a "bad target". Then shooted, the score will go down.
- Work on some descent sprites.
- Had more mechanics in shoots and targets. Like, bullets can go faster with player movement, or the targets can move.
- Improve the targets behaviour. When score goes up, target are going to get difficult to shoot. Also, can make them move, to make the game difficult.

#### Prototype 2: Platform collector

For the second game, as the first one, I didn't have a clear idea of what can I do. This problem get annoying, with the proximity of the due date, and also the beginning of week 2 of University. So, I standed in my standing desk, and trying to think: "Ok, I have to do something". Started my text editor, opened the music player, and get to open more Phaser examples, search about them, and go on. Finally, a platform game was more comfortable to do. But, I also putted some
mechanics to the idea, to make it a little more interesting. The game has the following features:

- The objective of the game, is to reach targets, that are going to randomly appear on screen.
- "Up arrows", that gives the player, a jump boost, making him more efficient when reaching points.
- If the player touches a dead point in the bottom of the screen, game over.
- If times goes out, game over.
