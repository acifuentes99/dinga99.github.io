Long time that I had no written in the blog. But the reason of that absence, it's because I put my attention and effort over the last weeks in some other courses of the University, and to another personal projects. Now, this the time off of the game, now I have better ideas to implement in the next days.

### Future Updates

* Random maps: Now, the game will have the feature of getting always random maps in every game.
* Boss battles: To make the game funnier, the player has to be prepared to face a boss, that will no care about enemies or players.
* Different weapons: More weapons are going to be available in the game, to make it more dynamic.

### Design Document

* In this days, for the Videogame Course, we have to write an Design Document for the game. In my documents, elements like the Story of the game, Mechanics, Idea, and other things are explained. To not make the post so long, I'm going to attach the Design Document in this post:

#### A brief summary of the story

I want to write about the plot and the story of the game, because that factor wasn't defined yet. Also, I find that that is important, because gives the game a more interesting propose of playing it, and also make the player feel like is in a story. So, here is the story:

At a very long year next, an human ship were searching for resources around the space. An incident happened, and all the humans get lost in the galaxy. So, our player awakes in a strange planet, with no much resources for himself.
Now, he has to explore the planet in order to survive, or also, find more resources for the earth. But, who knows?
